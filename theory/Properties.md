# Properties In Each Language
This document enumerates my desired properties in each languages' terms and types

## Sequence Language

### Terms
1. Standard functional programming operators


### Types
1. Total amount of data produced by a function equals total amount of data
   consumed by downstream function
   
## Space-Time IR

### Terms
1. Each operator has a single interpretation as hardware. This interpretation includes
    1. Throughput
    1. resource requirements
1. The buffering between terms is "minimal"

### Types
1. Throughput of data produced by a function equals throughput of data consumed
   by a downstream function

## Auto-Scheduler
1. The selected space-time IR schedule has the maximum throughput given resource requirements
