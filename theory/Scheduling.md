   support in order to enable scheduling
   
# Scheduling Definition
Scheduling is converting all the operators in a program from sequence language
to space-time IR.
Scheduling is performed to target a specific `input_throughput` and `output_throughput`
as defined in [the basic theory document's throughput section.](Basic.md#throughput).
The target is specified using a **throughput factor s**.
Scheduling with factor **s** means produce a pipeline with `input_throughput` and
`output_throughput` that are **s** times smaller than the fully parallel pipelines
`input_throughput` and `output_throughput`.


Scheduling is then performed by converting `Seq`s to `TSeq`s
and `SSeq`s. Different throughput schedules are expressed by different
computations of `TSeq`s and `SSeq`s. Scheduling a program P with a target
throughput t is done by:
1. Let t_full be the throughput by of P when fully parallelized
1. Let t = t_full / s
1. Each `Seq n` is converted to `TSeq` and `SSeq` by:
    1. s == 1 - make all nested Seqs into SSeqs
    1. s > 1, s < n of top Seq - split top nested Seq into TSeq (s) (SSeq (n /
      s) inner) and make all inner Seqs into SSeqs
    1. S > 1, s > n of top Seq - make top `Seq` into `TSeq n` inner, schedule the inner `Seq` with s'=(n / s)

# Auto-Scheduler 
The auto-scheduler finds the schedule with the maximum throughput given a
specified resource constraints.
1. Inputs: 
    1. `P_seq`: a program in the sequence language. 
    1. `area_max`: a resource constraint in area.
1. Outputs
    1. `P_st_optimal`: a program in the space-time IR with maximum throughput given resource constraints.

## Auto-Scheduler Algorithm
1. Apply the Sequence To Space rewrite rule to all operators in `P_seq`. Let `P_space` be the result.
1. If `area(P_space)` is less than `area_max`, stop. `P_space` is `P_st_optimal`
1. Let `N` be the set of all input and output sequence lengths, `n`, of all operators.
1. Let `N_factors` be the set of the common factors of all numbers in `N`. 
1. Sort `N_factors` from smallest to largest.
1. Let `factor_i = N_factors[i]`.
1. For `i` in `range(0, len(N_factors))`:
    1. Apply Slowdown rewrite rule to all operators in `P_space`. 
        1. Let `prod_factor_i` = product of `factor_j` for all j from 0 to i (inclusive).
        1. Let `P_i` be `P_space` after applying the slowdown rewrite rule with factor `prod_factor_i` rule to each operator in `P_space`.
    1. If `area(P_i)` is less than `area_max`, stop. `P_i` is `P_st_optimal`
1. If reached this point, fail as not able to fit program on chip even when fully slowed.

## Auto-Scheduler Correctness
We must prove that the auto-scheduling algorithm:

1. preserves time matching - **Pat: do we need to show this?**
2. preserves producer-consumer rate matching
3. trades-off time and area. Applying the slowdown rewrite rules decrease time without decreasing area. **Note: this can't be proven, see below.**
4. fins the maximum throughput schedule given resources constraints

### Slowdown Impact On Time And Area
Before proving the properties, we must formalize the impact of the slowdown rewrite rule on length, time, throughput.

1. **Length** - Inspecting the rewrite rules shows that length is unaffected by slowdown.
1. **Time** - Inspecting the rewrite rules shows that time is increased by slowdown `factor`. Formally, this is:
    - `time(slowdown(f, factor)) = time(f) * factor` 
1. **Throughput** - Since throughput is computed based on length and time:
    - `throughput(slowdown(f, factor)) = length(slowdown(f, factor)) / time(slowdown(f, factor)) =`
    - `length(f) / (time(f) * factor) = throuhgput(f) / factor`

**I don't know how to prove these statements.**

### Time Matching
We will show that all pipelines in the space-time IR that are produced by the auto-scheduler satisfy the time matching constraint.

1. `P_seq`. It has no time property.
1. `P_space` is fully parallel. For each operator `f_space` in `P_space`, `time(f_space) = 1`.
1. We will prove that `time(f_i)` is equal for all operators `f_i` in `P_i`. 
    1. Let `f_i` be the one or more operators produced by applying the slowdown rewrite rule to `f_space`: `f_i = slowdown(f_space, prod_factor_i)`.
    1. `time(f_space) = 1`
    1. `time(f_i) = prod_factor_i`
    1. All operators take same amount of time.
1. All operators in pipeline take same amount of time.

### Rate matching
We will show that all pipelines in the space-time IR that are produced by the auto-scheduler satisfy the producer-consumer rate matching constraint.

1. `P_seq`. It has no rate property.
1. `P_space` is fully parallel. We will prove that, for each pair of operators `g_space . f_space` in `P_space`, `input_throughput(g_space) == output_throughput(f_space)`.
    1. Let `f_seq` be an operator in `P_seq`. 
    1. Let `f_space` be the one or more operators produced by applying the sequence to space rewrite rule to `f_seq`.
    1. `time(f_space) = 1`.
    1. `input_length(f_space) = input_length(f_seq)` and `output_length(f_space) = output_length(f_seq)`, as noted in the [length property](#length) section.
    1. For any composition of operators `g_seq . f_seq`, `input_length(g_seq) == output_length(f_seq)`, as noted in the [sequence length property](#length-property) section.
    1. For the corresponding `g_space . f_space`, `input_length(g_space) == output_length(f_space)`.
    1. Also, `input_throughput(g_space) == output_throughput(f_space)`.

    ```
    input_throughput(g_space) == 
    input_length(g_space) / time(g_space) == 
    output_length(f_space) / time(f_space) == 
    output_throughput(f_space)
    ```

1. We will prove that, for each pair of operators `g_i . f_i` in `P_i`, `input_throughput(g_i) == output_throughput(f_i)`.
    1. For each `f_space`, let `f_i` be the one or more operators produced by applying the slowdown rewrite rule to `f_space`: `f_i = slowdown(f_space, prod_factor_i)`.
    1. `time(f_space) = 1`
    1. `time(f_i) = prod_factor_i`
    1. `input_length(f_i) = input_length(f_space)`
    1. `output_length(f_i) = output_length(f_space)`
    1. For all `g_i . f_i`, `input_throughput(g_i) == output_throughput(f_i)`.
    ```
    input_throughput(g_i) == 
    input_length(g_i) / time(g_i) == 
    input_length(g_space) / prod_factor_i == 
    output_length(f_space) / prod_factor_i == 
    output_length(f_i) / time(f_i) == 
    output_throughput(f_i)
    ```

All producer-consumer throughputs match in all pipelines.

### Time-Area Tradeoffs
Show for each operator that time value goes up, resources go down by evaluating the resources operator for each one

**Negative** - I don't think this can actually be proven. Increasing time increases area for `up_1d`. `up_1d_s` requires no memory area. `up_1d_t` requires memory. 

**Positive** - We still can have a linear search (following the common factors). The auto-scheduler provided above does this. It finds the most parallel implementation that fits on the target chip.

### Maximum Throughput Given Resource Constraints
This is the same proof as in the paper. I'm not going to reproduce here as it is not good. We already agreed it was too wordy.
